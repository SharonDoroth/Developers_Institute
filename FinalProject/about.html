                <p>Extraterrestrial life, colloquially referred to as alien life, 
                    is life that may occur outside of Earth and which did not originate on Earth.
                    No extraterrestrial life has yet been conclusively detected, although efforts are underway.
                    Such life might range from simple forms like prokaryotes to intelligent beings, possibly
                    bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than humankind.
                    The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe.
                    The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology. Specullation about the possibility 
                    of inhabited "worlds" outside the planet Earth dates back to antiquity. Multiple early Christian
                    writers discussed the idea of a "plurality of worlds" as proposed by earlier thinkers such as 
                    Democritus; Augustine references Epicurus's idea of innumerable worlds "throughout the boundless 
                    immensity of space" (originally expressed in his Letter to Herodotus) in The City of God.
                    In his first century poem De rerum natura (Book 2:1048–1076), the Epicurean philosopher Lucretius
                    predicted that we would find innumerable exoplanets with life-forms similar to, and different from, 
                    the ones on Earth, and even other races of man.</p>
                    <p>Pre-modern writers typically assumed that extraterrestrial "worlds" would be inhabited by living
                     beings. William Vorilong, in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility that Christ could have 
                     visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants. Nicholas of Cusa wrote in 1440 that 
                     the Earth was "a brilliant star" like other celestial objects visible in space, which would appear 
                     similar to the Sun from an exterior perspective due to a layer of "fiery brightness" in the outer 
                     layer of the atmosphere. He theorized that all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, 
                     plants, and animals, including the Sun.Descartes wrote that there was no means to prove that the 
                     stars were not inhabited by "intelligent creatures," but their existence was a matter of speculation.
                     The writings of these thinkers show that interest in extraterrestrial life existed throughout history,
                      
                     but it is only recently that humans have had any means of investigating it.
                    Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life,
                    encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for 
                    extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from the 
                    analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and send communication signals.
                    The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major 
                    cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Over the years, science fiction has communicated 
                    scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives 
                    on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with 
                    extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial 
                    life. Others—citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less 
                    advanced societies—argue that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.</p>
